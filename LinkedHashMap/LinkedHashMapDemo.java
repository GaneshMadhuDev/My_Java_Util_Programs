/**
 * HashMap provided the advantage of quick insertion, search, and deletion
 * but it never maintained the track and order of insertion which the LinkedHashMap
 * provides where the elements can be accessed in their insertion order.
 *
 * A LinkedHashMap contains values based on the key.
 * It contains only unique elements.
 * It is non-synchronized.
 * It  have one null key and multiple null values.
 *
 * It is the same as HashMap with an additional feature that it maintains insertion order.
